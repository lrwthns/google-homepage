This Google homepage mock-up took me around 6 days to finish. 

Day 1: Created index.html and style.css. Wrote all the necessary elements for the homepage.

Day 2: Tinkered with style.css but struggled tremendously with positioning, didn't know whether to use grid or flexbox. My head almost exploded.

Day 3: Decided to chill and just go through it. Brushed up on the basics by redoing some practices in freecodecamp.org, realizing how much information I didn't retain in my brain. Figured I could just use the position property instead of grid or flexbox. Beautified everything with the help of pseudo-classes (look at them links and buttons when you hover over!). Feeling pretty proud.

Day 4-5: Slacked off, it's the weekend!

Day 6: Procrastinated almost the whole day but then I sat my ass down and fiddled a bit more with positioning so that things look just right. Didn't take as long as I thought it would. I did it!


post-reflection: Looking at other students' solutions I realized I might have messed up positioning the contents because they're stuck in the same place when you zoom out the page. I dabbled with the pixels while most other solutions used the flexbox approach. I still have this to figure out but I'll just do it better on the next challenge.
